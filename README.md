# Food Compatibility

This is a datapack to bridge some recipe incompatibilities between different forge mods that add foods and food recipes to Minecraft 1.16. This is to ensure that, for example, if you're trying to Pam's Harvestcraft some green bean casserole, your Thermal Series green beans will actually work in it.

## Compatibility List

This version is tested with the following mods. That doesn't necessarily mean everything in these mods has been bridged yet, but, if a mod isn't here then I haven't written anything specifically for it.
